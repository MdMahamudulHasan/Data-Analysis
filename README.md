# Data Analysis Learning Repository

This repository contains code and notes from my learning journey, focusing on Python libraries for data analysis, including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. The tutorials are primarily based on resources from W3Schools.

## Libraries Covered:
- **NumPy:** Learning how to handle arrays, perform mathematical operations, and manipulate numerical data.
- **Pandas:** Exploring data manipulation, data frames, and series for efficient data analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Basic plotting and visualization techniques for displaying data.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to track my progress in mastering these libraries by writing and practicing code. It will also serve as a reference for future projects.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the code for each topic, which is organized into folders:
- `Numpy/`: Contains tutorials and exercises on array creation, operations, and more.
- `Pandas/`: Contains notebooks and scripts for working with data frames and cleaning data.
- `Matplotlib/`: Example plots and graphing techniques.
